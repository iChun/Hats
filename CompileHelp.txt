In libs put IChunUtil-deobf.jar , Morph-deobf.jar , and IChunUtil_AT.cfg
Copy that folder to "Hats\src\main\resources\assets\hats"
Note: you should now have 2 duplicate folders in ^^ and Hats

To Get IChunUtil-deobf.jar it is in "IChunUtil\src\main\resources\META-INF"
To Get Morph-deobf.jar compile morph like above but you don't need morph-deobf.jar
